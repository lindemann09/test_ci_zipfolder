<h4>Question</h4>

<p>Field describes a study on the growing interest in cosmetic surgery
treatments. He collected quality of life data from a sample of
respondents, some of whom had undergone cosmetic surgery and some of
whom were still on the waiting list for it (variable: surgery: 0 =
waiting list, 1 = cosmetic surgery). He measured the quality of life at
the time of application for the cosmetic surgery, the ‘baseline’ quality
of life (variable: Base_Qol, scale 0-1, a higher score means a higher
quality of life) and after some time, after the surgery had taken place
for those who underwent the surgery directly, but also at the same time
for the group who were still on the waiting list (variable: Post_Qol,
scale 0-100, a higher score means a higher quality of life).</p>
<p>Below are the results of a regression analysis with the post-measurement
of quality of life as the dependent variable (Post_Qol), and in which
having or not having had the cosmetic procedure (Surgery) and the
‘baseline’ quality of life (Base_Qol) are included in the model. In
addition, in Model 2, the interaction between surgery and baseline
quality of life (Base_Qol_surgery) was added to the model.<br />

<p>In regression model 1, the t-value of Base_Qol is omitted. What is the
t-value? Give a number with one decimal</p>
