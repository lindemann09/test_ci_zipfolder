Question
========
A researcher investigates the factors that may explain alcohol abuse among the elderly. Based on the theory, the researcher suspects that different dimensions can be distinguished concerning alcohol abuse. She designed 34 statements the elderly can agree or disagree with on a four-point scale (1 = completely agree; 2 = somewhat agree; 3 = somewhat disagree; 4 = completely disagree). An example of a statement is: When I feel lonely, I enjoy drinking an alcoholic beverage. The questionnaire was administered to 312 elderly (>70 years). The responses of the participants to the 34 statements are given in the dataset.

After conducting a factor analysis with principal axis factoring with 2 factors and a varimax rotation, what is the correlation between factor 1 and item 7? (3 decimals)

Solution
========
The correlation between factor 1 and item 7 after varimax rotation is 0.352 (see the rotated factor matrix for the factor loading of item 7 on factor 1).
