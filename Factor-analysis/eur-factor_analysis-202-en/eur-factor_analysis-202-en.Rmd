Question
========
In an oblique rotation spss gives a structure and a pattern matrix as output. Consider the following statements with respect to these matrices:

1. The correlations between the factors are zero in the structure matrix.
2. The numbers in the pattern matrix are the unique correlations between a factor and an item.

Answerlist
----------
* Statement 1 is correct and statement 2 is incorrect.
* Statement 2 is correct and statement 1 is incorrect.
* Statement 1 and 2 are both correct.
* Statement 1 and 2 are both incorrect.


Solution
========
Statement 1 is incorrect. The structure matrix contains the correlations between the items and the factors; in an oblique rotation the correlation between the factors is not necessarily zero. Statement 2 is correct: the pattern matrix contains the correlations between the factor and the items corrected for the correlation between factors.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
