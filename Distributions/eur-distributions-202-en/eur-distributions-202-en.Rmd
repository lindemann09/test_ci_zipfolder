Question
========
Evaluate the following statements about transformation of scores:

1. After standardizing raw scores, the scores will be approximately normally distributed.

2. When raw scores are normalized, a non-linear transformation is performed.


Answerlist
----------
* Statement 1 and statement 2 are both true
* Statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false
* Statement 1 is false and statement 2 is true
* Statement 1 and statement 2 are both false


Solution
========
Statement 1 is false: after standardization, the scores have the same distribution as the raw scores, which is not necessarily normal.

Statement 2 is correct: when scores are normalized, you have to perform a non-linear transformation in order to change the distribution of the raw scores (make them more normally distributed).

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* True
* False
