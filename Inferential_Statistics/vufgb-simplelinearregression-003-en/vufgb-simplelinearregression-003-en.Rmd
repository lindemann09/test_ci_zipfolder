Question
========

The linear relationship between two quantitative variables is investigated by using a simple linear regression analysis in a sample of 30 persons. The researcher wants to use an $\alpha$ level of 0.01. 

Which critical *t*-value fits the two-sided test for the linear relationship?
  
Answerlist
----------
* 2.457
* 2.467
* 2.750
* 2.763

Solution
========

In the simple regression model two parameters are estimated: intercept and regression coefficient. Therefore $df = n-2$. In this case $df = 30-2 = 28$. For a two-sided test with an $\alpha$-level of 0.01, fits a right-sided exceedance probability of: $\frac{0.01}{2} = 0.005$. The *t*-table shows the corresponding value at $df = 28$ and $t._{005}$. 

This value is 2.763.
