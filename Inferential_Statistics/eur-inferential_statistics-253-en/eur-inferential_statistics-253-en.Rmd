Question
========
A researcher is aware that he is a very narcissistic person, and wants to switch to a job in which this narcissism is not such a big deal. To determine which job he should choose he takes a random sample of the members of the International Club for Quite Narcissistic People (ICQNP) and determined the degree of narcissism using a questionnaire. In addition, he determined the job [Job, where CEO = 1, Manager = 2 and Statistician = 3] of the participants, and whether they are male [Gender = 0] or female [Gender = 1].

Test if there are differences between the three types of job [Job] in the average amount of narcism [Narcism]. Give the F-value. (3 decimals)
