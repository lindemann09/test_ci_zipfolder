Question
========
A researcher wants to find out whether the number of units of alcoholic beverages per occasion has a negative influence on the number of months a student needs to obtain his master degree in psychology, when he controls for intelligence (IQ).

He asks a random sample (N = 100) of freshly graduated psychologists about their alcohol consumption during the master program. Based on this information he classifies the subjects as non-drinkers, moderate drinkers, or heavy drinkers. Furthermore, for each subject the duration of the study and IQ were determined.

Which type of data analysis is, in theory, most suited for the above study?

Answerlist
----------
* Two-way factorial ANOVA
* Thee-way mixed ANOVA
* ANCOVA
* Repeated measures ANOVA


Solution
========
The correct answer is ANCOVA. You use an ANCOVA when you want to look at the effect of a categorical independent variable (type of drinker) on a continuous dependent variable (alcohol consumption), while controlling for another continuous variable/covariate (intelligence) that covariates with the dependent variable. Therefore, this is the most appropriate analysis for this study.

Two-way factorial anova is incorrect, as there is only one independent variable (type drinker). The researcher merely wants to control for IQ.

As this study is comparing groups, both three-way mixed ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA do not make sense, as they require some form of within-subjects element as well.
