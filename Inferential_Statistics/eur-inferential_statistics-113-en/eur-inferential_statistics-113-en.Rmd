Question
========
We predict Y from X1 using linear regression analysis. The Pearson correlation between X1 and Y is r = 0.40 and $s_Y^2$ = 100. When we add a second variable, X2, to the regression model we get $R^2$ = 0.25. How much additional variance is explained by the addition of X2 compared to the regression model with only X1?

Answerlist
----------
* 0.15 or 15%
* 0.09 or 9%
* 0.40 or 40%
* 0.25 or 25%

----------
* This answer is incorrect
* This is the correct answer! The explained variance in Y based on X1 alone equals $0.40^2$ = 0.16 or 16%. When X2 is added to the model, the total proportion of variance explained equals 0.25 of 25%; the increase is 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09 or 9%.
