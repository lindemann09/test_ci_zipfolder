Question
========
The following three group means are found: $\bar{y}_1 = 12$, $\bar{y}_2 = 8$ and $\bar{y}_3 = 10$. Group 3 is the reference category. We look at the corresponding estimated ANOVA model, but present it as a regression model with dummy variables. The formula is: $\hat{y} = 10 + 2Z_1 - 2Z_2$. What would the estimated model look like if group 1 were chosen as the reference category?

Answerlist
----------
* $\hat{y} = 10 - 2Z_1 + 2Z_2$
* $\hat{y} = 12 + 2Z_1 - 2Z_2$
* $\hat{y} = 12 - 2Z_1 + 2Z_2$
* $\hat{y} = 12 - 4Z_1 - 2Z_2$
