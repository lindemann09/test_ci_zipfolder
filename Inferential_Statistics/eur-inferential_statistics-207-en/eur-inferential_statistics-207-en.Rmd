Question
========
A researcher investigates the relationship between depression and sleeping problems using a sample of 55 participants. The reliability of the depression scale is high, Rxx=.82. However, sleeping problems are more difficult to measure and the reliability of this scale is Ryy=.62.

Calculate the maximum possible correlation the researcher can expect between depression and sleeping problems. Round to two decimals.

Use the formula: $r_{XoYo} = r_{XtYt} \times \sqrt {R_{XX}R_{YY}}$


Solution
========
The maximum correlation that can be obtained is the square root of the product of the two reliabilities times 1 (the true score correlation). Thus, the maximum correlation is: $rmax_{XoYo} = 1 \sqrt{R_{xx}R_{yy}} = \sqrt {.82 \times .62} = .71$
