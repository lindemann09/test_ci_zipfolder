Question
========

Given are the ANOVA tables of two regression models: one model with two predictors, and one model with two predictors and their interaction. 

Use the Model Comparison Test to determine whether there is a significant interaction.

Answerlist
----------
* $F(df_{1}=3, \; df_{2}=21)= 3.16 > 3.07$, so significant interaction
* $F(df_{1}=1, \; df_{2}=3)= 0.57 <10.13$, so no significant interaction
* $F(df_{1}=1, \; df_{2}=21)= 1.82 < 4.32$, so no significant interaction
* $F(df_{1}=1, \; df_{2}=1)= 0.54 < 161.4$, so no significant interaction

Solution
========

$F= \frac{[(SSE_{r}-SSE_{c})/df_{1}]}{[SSE_{c}/df_{2}]} =\frac{[(565-520)/1]}{[520/21]} = \frac{45}{24.76}=1.82$. With $df_{1} = 1$ (difference in dfâ€™s between complete and reduced model) and $df_{2} = 21$ (df of SSE in complete model). Look in the *F*-table at $df_{1} = 1$ and $df_{2}=21$ what the critical F-value is, this is 4.32. Founded F < critical F, so adding the interaction-term in model 2 does not lead to significant less error, so there is no significant interaction.
