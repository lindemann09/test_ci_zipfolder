Question
========
When performing a regression analysis, the regression equation is determined by minimizing:

Answerlist
----------
* the total squared error (residual) between the predicted and the observed Y values
* the total absolute error (residual) between the predicted and the observed Y value
* the total absolute error (residual) between the values of X and Y
* the total squared error (residual) between the values of X and Y


Solution
========
The regression equation is meant to plot out the perfect line through all datapoints, meaning the least total squared error (residual) between the predicted and the observed Y values
