Question
========
A huge amount of empirical research showed that there is a rather strong relationship between depression and anxiety. Suppose that the true correlation between these two constructs is .70. A researcher who investigates this relationship with a sample of 80 participants has poor reliabilities for his depression (Rxx=.4) and anxiety (Ryy=.6) measures. 

What observed correlation can he expect for his data? Round to two decimals.
Use the formula: $r_{XoYo} = r_{XtYt} \times \sqrt {R_{XX}R_{YY}}$


Solution
========
Using the formula, you would get $r_{XoYo} = .7 \times \sqrt {.4 \times .6} = .343$
The expected correlation is therefore .34.
