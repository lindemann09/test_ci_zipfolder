Answerlist
----------
* 4
* 16
* 20
* 40

Solution
========

The unstandardized residual is the difference between the observed frequency in a cell and the expected frequency in a cell, under the null hypothesis (no relationship between two categorical variables) in a cross-table. The observed frequency for the cell Divorced-Low education is 20. The expected frequency (at the null hypothesis) is given by the product of the row and column totals of the cell, divided by the total $N: \; \frac{80 \times 48}{240} = 16$.

The unstandardized residual is: $20-16 = 4$.
