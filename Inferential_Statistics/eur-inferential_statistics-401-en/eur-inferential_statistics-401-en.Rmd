Question
========
A knowledge test on alcohol contains 20 items and is administered to 202 high school students. The variable [total score] gives the total correct scores. Gender (0 = woman; 1 = man) and alcohol use (0 = very often; 1 = often; 2 = sometimes; 3 = never) are also included in the dataset. 

A researcher wants to investigate whether he can predict the total score with an IQ score and wonders whether this relation is different for boys and girls. Conduct a regression analysis to investigate this question. What is the unstandardized regression coefficient of the interaction effect gender x IQ score? Note: Make sure that gender is coded as 0 for the girls and 1 for the boys. (3 decimals)

Solution
========
The unstandardized coefficient for the interaction effect (gender x IQ) is -0.096. First compute an interaction variable (gender*IQ). Then use regression to predict the total score with gender, IQ and the interaction as the predictors. Finally find the coefficient for the interaction effect.
