Question
========
Feyenoord and Ajax fans often criticize each other's teams. We will be looking at what team a person is a fan of [Fan, where Feyenoord = 0 and Ajax = 1], in what city a person lives [City, where Rotterdam = 1, Amsterdam = 2, Dordrecht = 3 and Haarlem = 4], the number of games played by the favourite team that they watched over the years (so the amount of games played by Feyenoord watched by a Feyenoord fan) [played_favourite] and to the amount of games played by the other team that someone watched over the years [played_other]. We also registered whose team became division champion in the last 4 years [Champion, where No championship = 0 and Championship = 1].

Compute a new variable on which people from Amsterdam and Haarlem are one group, and people from Rotterdam and Dordrecht are the other. Determine if the average number of “games by the other team that someone watched” of the "Amsterdam+Haarlem" group, is significantly different from that of the “Rotterdam+Dordrecht”group. Report the obtained p-value (using 3 decimals).
