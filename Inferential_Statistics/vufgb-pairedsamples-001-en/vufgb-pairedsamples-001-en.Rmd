Question
========
In a study, performance on a puzzle task (i.e., number of correctly laid puzzle pieces) is measured in children. This is done during two conditions. First, performance on the puzzle task is measured while the children are alone. Second, the performance of the same children is measured, but now in the presence of their mother. We want to know whether there is a statistically significant difference in mean performance on the task between the two conditions. With which statistical technique can this be tested?

----------
* The $χ^2$-test for independence.
* The McNemar’s test for dependent proportions.
