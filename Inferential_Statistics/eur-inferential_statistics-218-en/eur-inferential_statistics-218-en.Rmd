Question
========
When the interaction between the between-subjects factor and the covariate is significant, which assumption of ANCOVA is statistically violated?

Answerlist
----------
* linearity of the relationship between the variables
* normality of residuals
* homogeneity of regression slopes
* independence of the covariate and the between-subjects factor


Solution
========
A significant interaction indicates that the slopes of the different groups differ significantly from each other. The assumption of the homogeneity of the slopes is thus violated.

All other assumptions cannot be assessed with the information we currently possess.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* True
* False
