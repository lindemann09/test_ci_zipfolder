Question
========
In a repeated measures design with anxiety as the outcome variable and the variable stimulus (neutral, picture of spider, real spider) as ws-factor, Post-hoc tests are conducted for the significant main effect of stimulus.

The mean difference between neutral and real spiders is 3.5. The Post-hoc test for this difference in SPSS results in t(7) = -4.78, p = .002 (two-tailed). What does this p-value represent?

The above p-value indicates that the probability of finding:

Answerlist
----------
* A mean population difference between neutral and real spiders of 0 is .002 or more extreme.
* A mean sample difference between neutral and real spiders of plus or minus 3.5 is .002.
* A mean sample difference between neutral and real spiders of plus or minus 3.5 or more extreme when the population difference equals 0 is .002.
* A mean sample difference between neutral and real spider that is significant in the population when the population difference equals 0 is .002 or more extreme.


Solution
========
The p-value represents the probability of the sample result found (in this case a difference between the groups of 3.5 points) or more extreme if the null hypothesis were true.

Answerlist
----------
