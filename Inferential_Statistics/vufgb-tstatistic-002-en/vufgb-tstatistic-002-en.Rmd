Question
========
  
Given is a *t*-distribution with 23 degrees of freedom.

A which *t*-value the 97.5% of the values is at the right side?
  
Answerlist
----------
* -2.500
* -2.069
* 2.069
* 2.500 

Solution
========

Look in the *t*-table at $df = 23$.

A *t*-value of 2.069 gives a right exceedance probability of 2.5%. This means 2.5% of the values lies at the right side. For a *t*-value of -2.069, 2.5% of the values lies at the left side, and so 97.5% of the values at the right side.

*Advice: Draw the t-distribution and put the *t*-values and the corresponding exceedance probability of the 4 answer options in the drawing!*
