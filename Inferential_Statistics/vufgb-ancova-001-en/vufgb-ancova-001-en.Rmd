Question
========
Consider an experiment. In it, the effect of Social Stress (Factor with two groups: $z_{1}$) on Performance (Dependent variable: $y$ ) is studied. The researchers used a standard ANCOVA, controlling for Neuroticism (Covariate: $x$, with $\bar{x} = 20$). The following estimated regression equation is found: $\hat{y}=25+0.8_{x}+2z_{1}$. Calculate the adjusted means for both groups of the Factor.
