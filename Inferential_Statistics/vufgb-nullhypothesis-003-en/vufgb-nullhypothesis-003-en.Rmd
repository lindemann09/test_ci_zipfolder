Question
========

The image below visualizes the univariate and multivariate rejection areas for two outcomes $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ if for at least one outcome measure the null hypothesis is rejected. Imagine that in a particular sample the combination of results indicated by point P is observed. What is then the conclusion with univariate testing and what with multivariate testing?
