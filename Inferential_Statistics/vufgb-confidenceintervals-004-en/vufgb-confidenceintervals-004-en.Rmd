Question
========
We want to investigate whether there is a difference in mood swings between people with and without Huntingtonâ€™s disease. A random sample of 11 participants is selected from both groups. Then, they are asked to participate in the research. Mood swings are measured on a numerical scale. The results are presented in the table below. Assume equal variances when determining the degrees of freedom for your test statistic. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in mood swings.
