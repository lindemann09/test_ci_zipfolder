Question
========
A repeated measures ANOVA has more power than an ANOVA for independent groups, because one variance component is calculated differently. Which variance component is this?

Answerlist
----------
* The Sum of Squares Total
* The Sum of Squares Model
* The Sum of Squares Residual
* None of the above


Solution
========
Individual differences between participants matters less for repeated measures analyses. Each participant's score is measured at a minimum of 2 different occasions; the difference between these conditions within participants is what's relevant. An individual who starts at a 0 and ends at a 2 (difference of 2) has the same difference score as someone who starts at a 5 and ends at a 7.
