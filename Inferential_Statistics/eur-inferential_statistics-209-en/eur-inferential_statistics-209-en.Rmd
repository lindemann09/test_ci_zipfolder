Question
========
An experiment of a PhD student has a reliability of .64 and true score effect size of .8. Calculate the expected effect size using the formula: $d_{Xo} = d_{Xt} \times \sqrt{r_{xx}}$. Round to 2 decimals.


Solution
========
Given the above formula, the true score effect size (.8) and the reliability (.64), the expected effect size is $d_{Xo} = .8 \sqrt{.64} = .64$
