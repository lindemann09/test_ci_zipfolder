Question
========
A researcher is interested in the consequences of the financial crisis for 16- and 17-year olds. She wants to predict their leisure expenses in November 2012 [expenses_nov] from a number of predictors. She collected data from 202 teenagers: 1) leisure expenses in November 2012 [expenses_nov]; 2) leisure expenses in July 2012 [expenses_jul]; 3) income from their side occupation in November 2012 [salary_nov]; 4) time spent on studying [studytime]; and 5) their educational level [education] (1 = vmbo, 2 = havo, 3 = vwo)*.

**translation for the Dutch education levels: (1 = Lower General Secondary Education, 2 = Higher General Secondary Education, 3 = Pre-university Education)*

Open the data file.

How much did the proportion of explained variance in leisure expenses in November 2012 [expenses_nov] increase after the variable educational level [education] was added as a predictor to the model?
