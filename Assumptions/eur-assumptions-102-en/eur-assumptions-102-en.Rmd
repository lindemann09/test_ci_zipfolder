Question
========
*Testing effect* 

Research has shown that when people learn words from a foreign language they better remember those words if they first study the words and then test themselves trying to recollect the words, compared to just studying the words twice. A researcher from the institute of psychology wants to know whether this so-called testing effect can be proven to exist in the classroom. She divides a group of 60 students into three groups [condition]. The students in group 1 study a list of 30 French words and their Dutch translation twice (1 = restudy). The students in group 2 study the list of 30 French words and their Dutch translation once and then test themselves (2 = testing). The students in group 3 just study the list of 30 French words and their Dutch translation once without testing themselves (3 = study_once). A week after the study phase, the students took a test where they had to give the Dutch translation of the 30 French words that they studied earlier. The total number of correct translations is represented by the variable score [score]. Additionally, the researcher included for each student his/her French grade [French].

Open the data file.

Conduct an analysis to determine whether the regression lines for the relation between French grade [French] and test performance [score] differ for the three conditions [condition]. What is p-value corresponding to the F-test of the homogeneity of regression slopes assumption? (3 decimals)

Solution
========
The p-value is .872. The correct analysis is ANCOVA where you test the two main effects of condition and French + their interaction (condition*French). The F-value for the interaction effect is 0.138, the p-value is .872.
