Answerlist
----------
* The presence of outliers in the Y-space has been checked and the condition is not met. In other words, the analysis may not be carried out.
* The presence of outliers in the X-space has been checked and the condition has been met. In other words, the analysis may be carried out.
* The presence of outliers in the XY-space has been checked and the condition is met. In other words, the analysis may be carried out.
* The presence of multicollinearity has been checked and the condition is not met. In other words, the analysis may not be carried out.


Solution
========
Cook's distance is used to determine whether there are outliers in XY-space. The rule of thumb is that values below 1 do not indicate outliers. The maximum value of Cook's distance in this analysis is .100. This is lower than 1, so the assumption is met.
