Answerlist
----------
* F-change is significant, so the linearity assumption is satisfied. 
* F-change is significant, so the linearity assumption is not satisfied.  
* F-change is not significant, so the linearity assumption is satisfied. 
* F-change is not significant, so the linearity assumption is not satisfied. 



Solution
========
F-change (comparing model 1 to model 2) is significant, indicating that adding x-squared is a significant improvement to the model and therefore the linearity assumption is not satisfied.
