Question
========
  
A friend of yours knows you are taking a statistics class and wants to ask you a question about his thesis. He is using multiple linear regression and calculates the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The test gives a p-value of $.054$ and your friend is unsure if he has violated the homoscedasticity assumption. What advice should you give your friend if $\alpha =.05$ is used?
  
Answerlist
----------
* Homoscedasticity is upheld because the p-value is greater than .05.
* Homoscedasticity is violated because the p-value is greater than .05.
* There is some evidence that homoscedasticity may be violated, but it is important to know the sample size before drawing a definitive conclusion.
* You cannot help your friend because this test does not address the homoscedasticity assumption.
