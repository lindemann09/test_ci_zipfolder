Question
========
Included in this question is SPSS output from a multiple regression model from a dataset from the US National Center of Educational Statistics. This dataset is called High School Beyond and has data on variables related to students’ academic achievement. Specifically, the outcome variable for the regression model is “Math Score” which is predicted from “Locus of Control”, “Self-Concept”, and “Reading Score”. In addition, the Appendix includes plots that were created from the same model. Use the plots to help you answer questions about assumptions of the regression model for the High School Beyond dataset. 
  
Using only the information provided below, can you determine if the homoscedasticity assumption was met? If yes, state which plot, table, or statistic gives you information about this assumption and state your conclusion regarding whether the homoscedasticity assumption was upheld. If the appropriate plot, table, or statistic is not provided, discuss which plot, table or statistic you would need to assess this assumption.

Solution
========
  
Yes, the homoscedasticity assumption is met. The graph that was used was the residual plot (standardized residuals vs. standardized predicted values).
