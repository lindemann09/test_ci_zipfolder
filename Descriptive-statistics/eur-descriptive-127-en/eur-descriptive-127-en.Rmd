Question
========
Open the SPSS file.

An error has been made in the calculation of the course exam of course 2.2 (variable course 2_2). The grade of each student has to be recalculated by adding 0.2 points to the current score. Please do this recalculation and report the mean for the new grades of course 2.2. Please note that for some students the new course exam score is higher than 10. You do not need to correct for that in the calculation of the mean. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
