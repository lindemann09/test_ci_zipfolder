Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed 34 statements the adolescents can agree or disagree with on a four-point scale (1. completely agree; 2. somewhat agree; 3. somewhat disagree; 4. completely disagree). An example of a statement is: When I feel lonely, I enjoy drinking an alcoholic beverage. The answers of 312 girls (0) and boys (1) to the 34 statements are in the dataset. Also included in the dataset are IQ scores, scale scores and the amount of alcohol use (1 = very often; 2 = often; 3 = sometimes; 4 = never).

Make a group containing the 33.333% highest scoring adolescents on the scale score (variable [scale]). What is the mean of this group on the variable [IQ]? (2 decimals)

Solution
========
The mean IQ of this group is 109.17. First a new variable has to be computed using the percentile scores and the recode into different variable function. After, find the mean IQ of this highest scoring group.
