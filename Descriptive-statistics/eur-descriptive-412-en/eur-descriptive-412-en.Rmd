Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed 34 statements the adolescents can agree or disagree with on a four-point scale (1. completely agree; 2. somewhat agree; 3. somewhat disagree; 4. completely disagree). An example of a statement is: When I feel lonely, I enjoy drinking an alcoholic beverage. The answers of 312 girls (0) and boys (1) to the 34 statements are in the dataset. Also included in the dataset are IQ scores, scale scores and the amount of alcohol use (1 = very often; 2 = often; 3 = sometimes; 4 = never).

How many adolescents have a scale score (variable [scale]) that is more than 2 standard deviations above the group mean? (no decimals)
