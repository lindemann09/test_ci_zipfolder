Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed a questionnaire with 12 items using Likert scales ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). An example of an item is: When I go out, I often consume more than 5 alcoholic beverages. The answers of 608 adolescent girls (1) and boys (2) to the 12 items are in the dataset. Note: higher scores on the questionnaire reflect more alcohol abuse.

Calculate the total score by summing all the answers to all the items. Take the missings into account when calculating the total score and donâ€™t include people who gave less than 8 answers. Make sure the total score is rounded. What is the mean of the total score? (3 decimals)
