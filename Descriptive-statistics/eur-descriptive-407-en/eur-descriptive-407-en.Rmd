Question
========
A knowledge test on alcohol contains 20 items and is administered to 202 high school students. The variable [total score] gives the total correct scores. Gender (0 = woman; 1 = man) and alcohol use (0 = very often; 1 = often; 2 = sometimes; 3 = never) are also included in the dataset. 

Convert the total score of each student to a normalized score (rankit) with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 5. Round the normalized score. What is the normalized total score of the student with id=31? (no decimals)
