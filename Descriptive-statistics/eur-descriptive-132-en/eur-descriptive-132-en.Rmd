Question
========
A researcher is interested in the consequences of the financial crisis for 16- and 17-year olds. She wants to predict their leisure expenses in November 2012 [expenses_nov] from a number of predictors. She collected data from 202 teenagers: 1) leisure expenses in November 2012 [expenses_nov]; 2) leisure expenses in July 2012 [expenses_jul]; 3) income from their side occupation in November 2012 [salary_nov]; 4) time spent on studying [studytime]; and 5) their educational level [education] (1 = vmbo, 2 = havo, 3 = vwo)*.

translation for the Dutch education levels: (1 = Lower General Secondary Education, 2 = Higher General Secondary Education, 3 = Pre-university Education)

Open the data file.

Compute the correlations between the predictors: [expenses_jul], [salary_nov], [studytime] and the outcome variable expenses in november 2012 [expenses_nov]. Choose in this analysis a listwise exclusion of missing values. Which predictor has the highest correlation with the outcome variable? Report this correlation. (3 decimals)
