Question
========
The course coordinator of course 1.4 administered an exam consisting of 60 multiple choice questions with for each question one correct answer and three incorrect answers. In the instruction is written that all unanswered questions are graded as being incorrect answers. It turned out that quite a few students had run out of time and only finished the first 40 questions. The course coordinator wants to calculate the total scores using SPSS. What kind of function does she have to use?

Answerlist
----------
* rnd(60*mean.60(item1 to item60)
* rnd(40*mean.40(item1 to item60))
* rnd(60*mean.40(item1 to item60))
* sum(item1 to item60)


Solution
========
Since missing answers are rated as incorrect, we can simply use the function "sum". With sum, missing scores are not taken into account so the sum score is the number of correct answers.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* False
* True
