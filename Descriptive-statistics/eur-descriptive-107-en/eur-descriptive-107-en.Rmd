Question
========
Fill in: “larger than”, “smaller than” or “equal to”:
When a variable is normally distributed the mean is .... the median.


Solution
========
When a variable is distributed negatively skewed, the mean is smaller than the median. When a variable is negatively skewed, the tail of the distribution is at the left side. The mean, and not the median is influenced by these small numbers and is therefore smaller than the median.
