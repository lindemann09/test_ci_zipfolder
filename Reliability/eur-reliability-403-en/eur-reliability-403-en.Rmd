Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed a questionnaire with 12 items using Likert scales ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). An example of an item is: When I go out, I often consume more than 5 alcoholic beverages. The answers of 608 adolescent girls (1) and boys (2) to the 12 items are in the dataset. Note: higher scores on the questionnaire reflect more alcohol abuse.

Previous research has shown that boys engage in more alcohol abuse than girls. Because of this finding, a researcher wants to calculate the reliability of the questionnaire for boys and girls separately (variable [gender]). What is the reliability (Cronbachâ€™s alpha) of the scale for the girls? (3 decimals)

Solution
========
The reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale for the girls is 0.780 (turn on split file to create subgroups for gender before conducting the analysis).
