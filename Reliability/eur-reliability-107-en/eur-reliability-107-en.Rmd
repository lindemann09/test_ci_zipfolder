Question
========
Why is the assumption of essentially tau equivalent items more liberal than the assumption of parallel items?


Solution
========
The assumption of essentially tau equivalent items is more liberal than the assumption of parallel items because for essentially tau equivalent items no equal error variance is required. Thus, it only needs one out of the two assumptions required by the concept of parallelism under the classical testing theory (i.e. equality of true scores and equality of error variance).
