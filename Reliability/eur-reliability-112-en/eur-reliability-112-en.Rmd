Question
========
Twenty parallel items are removed from an 80 items questionnaire that had an alpha of .92. What will be the new alpha?
Use the formula below:

$R_{xx-revised} = \frac{n \times R_{XX-original}}{1+(n-1) R_{XX-original}}$


Note that n = lengthening factor. Original number of items x lengthening factor = new number of items.


Solution
========
In order to calculate the new alpha we need the Spearman‚ÄêBrown formula. In this case n is $\frac{60}{80}=.75$
So: $R_{xx-revised} = \frac{.75\times.92}{1+(.75-1).92} = .896$.
