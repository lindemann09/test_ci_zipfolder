Question
========
Why is the split‐half reliability not often used in contemporary psychometrics?


Solution
========
It is not often used because Cronbach’s alpha is a better alternative that is also provided in most statistical applications. Cronbach’s alpha is actually the averaged split‐half reliability of all possible splittings.
