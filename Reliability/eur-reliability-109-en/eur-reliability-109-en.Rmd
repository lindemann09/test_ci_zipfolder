Question
========
Explain why high Cronbach's alpha values do not indicate that a test is uni‚Äêdimensional.


Solution
========
When a test consists of several subsets of items that measure different constructs, the alpha coefficient of the total test can still be high when the covariances within the subsets are relatively high and the covariances between items of different clusters are not too low.
