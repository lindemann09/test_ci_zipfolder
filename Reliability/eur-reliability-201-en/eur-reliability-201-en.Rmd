Question
========
What is the effect of a disproportional number of easy questions in a performance test on the reliability of the performance test?

Answerlist
----------
* The reliability of the test is lower in a population consisting of people who have a relatively low ability level than in a population consisting of people with a relatively high ability level.
* The reliability of the test is higher in a population consisting of people who have a relatively low ability level than in a population consisting of people with a relatively high ability level.
* The reliability of the test will be more or less the same in a population consisting of people who have a relatively low ability level and in a population consisting of people with a relatively high ability level.
* It is not possible to do any predictions on the basis of the difficulty of questions about the reliability of a test in populations that differ with respect to their average ability level.


Solution
========
Relatively many easy items means that the test is relatively easy that is suited for people with low ability: it discriminates well between low ability scores. Since high ability people will give correct answers to most of the easy questions the test does not discriminate well between high ability scores. So the test is more reliable for low ability than for high ability level.
