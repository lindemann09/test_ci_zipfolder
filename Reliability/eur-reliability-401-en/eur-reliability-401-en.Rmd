Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed a questionnaire with 12 items using Likert scales ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). An example of an item is: When I go out, I often consume more than 5 alcoholic beverages. The answers of 608 adolescent girls (1) and boys (2) to the 12 items are in the dataset. Note: higher scores on the questionnaire reflect more alcohol abuse.

Conduct a reliability analysis. What is the scale variance when all the items are included? (3 decimals)
