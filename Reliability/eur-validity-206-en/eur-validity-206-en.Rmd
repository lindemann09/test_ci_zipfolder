Question
========
Two researchers working in a detention clinic (such as the Dutch TBS) discuss the effect of malingering on the reliability and the validity of a test that is used to predict successful rehabilitation in society. This is because the patients gave a 3 response (not agree/ not disagree) on all 5-point Likert statements of the test.

What can you say about the validity and the reliability?

Answerlist
----------
* Because malingering produces non-systematic variance, the reliability will be affected negatively. The validity is also negatively affected.
* Because malingering produces systematic variance, the reliability will be affected positively. The validity is however negatively affected.
* Because malingering produces non-systematic variance, the reliability will be affected positively. The validity is also positively affected.
* Because malingering produces systematic variance, the reliability will be affected negatively. The validity is also negatively affected.


Solution
========
Since most of the patients chose the same answer category for most items, their malingering leads to systematic variance which increases the reliability estimate. The validity of their test scores is negatively influenced by their malingering since their scores do not reflect their true successful rehabilitation.
